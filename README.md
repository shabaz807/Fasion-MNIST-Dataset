# Fasion-MNIST-Dataset
Building a neural network using PyTorch and train it on the fashion-MNIST dataset.

> The architecture of the neural network that's built is given below.
> The choice of selection of Activation functions, Optimizers, Batch sizes, and other hyperparameters is yours. But make sure you use the suitable ones.
> Make sure you train your model on GPU in google colaboratory.
> Train your model in mini-batches using the DataLoader.
> Plot the Loss Curve.
> Plot the accuracy curves for train and test sets.
> During training, don't forget to save your models that give the highest accuracy score (or) the lowest loss value.
> Load the saved model that gave the best performance during training and calculate it's accuracy score on train and test datasets.
> Take a batch from test loader and plot the images in the batch by forming a grid as shown in the "Classification with neural network" video.
> Print the predictions by the model on that test batch that you plotted... Just below the plot itself.

It might take a while for training.
the hyper parameter tuning can be done for much better results.
